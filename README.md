# Systematic comparison of methods for kinase activity estimation

<!-- badges: start -->

## Overview
In this study, we present a flexible framework to assess different combinations of computational algorithms and kinase-substrate libraries 
for the inference of kinase activities. For the benchmark, we use a set of kinase perturbation experiments to evaluate which combination
is able to recapitulate the perturbed kinases from the phosphoproteomics data. Additionally, we propose a new benchmarking strategy based
on multi-omics tumor data.

If you want to test your own method try out our package [benchmarKIN](https://github.com/saezlab/benchmarKIN) and check out the 
[documentation](https://benchmarkin.readthedocs.io/).

## Kinase substrate libraries
We have included the following kinase-substrate libraries:
- PhosphoSitePlus
- PTMsigDB
- Omnipath
- Gold Standard set of GPS 6.0
- iKiP-db
- NetworKIN

Additionally have tested the combination with predicted targets including the Kinase Library and Phosformer.

## Methods
We have included the following methods for the comparison:
- fgsea
- Fisher's exact test
- KARP
- KSEA
- Kologomorov-Smirnov
- linear model - RoKAI
- Mann-Whitney-U test
- mean
- median
- multivatiate linear model - decoupler
- normalised mean
- Principal Component Analysis
- PTM-SEA
- sum
- univariate linear model - decoupler
- upper quantile
- VIPER
- z-score
- X-square test
